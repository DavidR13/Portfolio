# Portfolio

My personal portfolio website was built using **HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and a tiny amount of JS for the front-end, and then Python, Flask, and PostgreSQL through SQLAlchemy for the back-end**. Specifically, the back-end was especially necessary because I envisioned having a blog where only I could post things -- that would allow me to develop a community and show to myself that I'm understanding what I'm learning. With the back-end, I was able to add user authentication, connect to a database, and add posts to that database with whatever I want to add, and it would immediately reflect on the front-end. For hosting, I used Heroku with the Heroku CLI to make deployment quick, easy, and powerful given that they allow you to have a remote PostgreSQL database.

While not too complex, I hope that my portfolio can show to others the love and interest that I have for programming, and that others can learn more about me through the different sections I've included. It was a really enjoyable experience making my personal portfolio because I was able to learn many new things, and was able to put them together and see the results of all that work.

## Description
For my personal portfolio website, these tools were necessary given that I wanted to include a personal blog, which would require a back-end. I envisioned having a blog where **only I** could post things -- that would allow me to develop a community and show to myself that I'm understanding what I'm learning. With the back-end, I was able to add user authentication, connect to a database, and add or remove posts to that database, and it would immediately reflect on the front-end. For hosting, I used Heroku with the Heroku CLI to make deployment quick, easy, and powerful given that they allow you to have a remote PostgreSQL database.

While not too complex, I hope that my portfolio can show to others the love and interest that I have for programming, and that others can learn more about me through the different sections I've included. It was a really enjoyable experience making my personal portfolio because I was able to learn many new things, and was able to put them together and see the results of all that work.
